## Usage Info

Once the program has been run, a series of question prompts will appear, First asking for a 3 or less character input to determin the characters on the logo, next a color selection for that text, followed by a list of three shapes to choose from, either a Square, Circle or Triangle. Once selected, you then are to input the color for the shape and thus all data has been entered. This will now generate a file called logo.svg and when opened on a web browser will display an image of the logo just created.
